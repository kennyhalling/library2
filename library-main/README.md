# Overview
This is a demo program for an application that could theoretically be used by visitors at a library to easily navigate the books offered there. This program provides a way for users to easily view, search for, check out, and return books belonging to a library.

I wrote this software to test my skills with C#, and to refresh myself on the things that I've learned in the language over the years. I wanted to push myself to learn new things in the language as well, such as reading and writing to files outside the program.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used VS Code on my Windows 11 laptop.

I wrote the software in the object-oriented language C# and used the Newtonsoft.Json library to serialize and deserialize Json in my program. The book data itself comes from the Open Library API that I fetched prior to writing the program.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to make it so that users can check out books by title rather than just by serial number.
- I want to make it possible for a user to add a new book to the database provided they have the right employee credentials.
- I want to make a GUI that is more sleek and user friendly than a terminal.
